*Response to a [Call for Papers](https://www.cutter.com/call-papers#disruptagile){:target="_blank"} from the Cutter Business Technology Journal.*

Update: My paper proposal has been accepted and will be published in the April issue.

## Abstract

Much has transpired in the nineteen years since the original publication of the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://agilemanifesto.org/){:target="_blank"}. After nearly two decades, the word *agile* now saturates conversations in the software industry, and has even overflowed into the popular business vernacular. It seems now that nearly every company seeks recognition for their ability to *do agile* in their workplace. Surely such efforts reflect noble intentions. Yet stories abound regarding the challenges and frustrations software engineers have experienced in the real consequences of such intentions. They recount numerous tales of processes and practices which instead resulted in reduced **agility**.

As words enter the general vocabulary, their use and the way they are understood often changes. Sometimes we hardly notice the difference, even in the wake of significant impact from the change. Such alterations of meaning have occurred in reference to the word *agile*. In the context of the title of [the manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/){:target="_blank"} that catalyzed the movement, the word functioned as an adjective.  Over time, however, *agile* has shifted into common use as a noun. I believe this semantic shift has had a profound impact on how software engineers, development managers, and the industry in general, understand, experience, and influence the trajectory of the movement. Targeting **agility** as a goal for software teams diminished over time, replaced instead with efforts to *do agile* by following prescribed, formulaic practices.

> Successful businesses do not measure success by how well they conform to a set of methodologies or practices, regardless of the intriguing names or prestigious sounding certifications that come with them.

Successful businesses recognize the critical need for **agility** in the face of market competition, industry complexity, and the relentless turbulence of the technology landscape. They do not measure success by how well they conform to a set of methodologies or practices, regardless of the intriguing names or prestigious sounding certifications that come with them. The hallmarks of **agility** reveal themselves in values, priorities, and cultural attributes that enable software teams to deliver real value to customers efficiently, effectively, and frequently. The software industry must stop and reflect on the good, the bad and the ugly in the history of misguided attempts to *do agile*. The time has come for a disruption of *agile* in the pursuit of true **agility**.

Stay tuned for the full paper, to be published soon!

<!-- <br />
The remainder of the paper will encourage the industry to refocus on what attributes actually enable **agility**.

What really matters for attaining **agility**:
* Satisfied Customers
  * Requiring:
    * Excellent Listening and Interviewing Skills
    * Emotional Intelligence
    * Embracing Changing Requirements
    * ...
* Empowered Stakeholders
  * Requiring:
    * Leadership
    * Commitment
    * Accountability
    * Experience
    * Conway & Parkinson
    * Epistemic Humility
    * ...
* Continuous Improvement
  * Requiring:
    * Relentless commitment to quality
    * Waste Elimination
    * Measurement (how can you improve what you don't measure? **real** metrics only, not vanity metrics or the appearance of measurement)
    * Optimal Constraints
    * Innovation and Creativity
    * Technical Empathy
    * ...

Let's make that hope a reality, disrupting *agile* by reclaiming true **agility**. -->

## From the call for papers

* What made agile disruptive?
* What conditions allowed the ideas to be disruptive?
* Is agile now ready for disrupting? If so, why and what would it look like?
* What if the very characteristics that made agile successful are no longer enough? 
* Have the underlying assumptions about team size and organization, decision-making authority, product arrangement, and customer involvement run their course?
* Proponents say others "are not doing it right"
* Premise: disruption is needed to keep agile alive and relevant
* What factors are contributing to the ineffectiveness of agile?
* What is needed for agile to operate and deliver results in non-ideal contexts?
* Are the underlying assumptions about team size and organization sound?
* Where should decision-making authority lay?
* Have product arrangement and customer involvement run their course?
* What can be changed to keep all that works well in agile while freeing agile to also work in unanticipated situations?
* How can disruptive agile improve customer delight?
* What’s changed in the past two decades that agile can now leverage?
* Are there any current, albeit less popular, agile ideas that should be brought into the spotlight?

Iterative: Means that you do things in reasonable chunks of work that repeat on a basic rhythm.
Incremental: Means that you can come back to a piece you worked on before and extend it.
Empiracle: Means that your decisions for zigs and zags are based on data from your plan, resources, and progress.

You have a Project Plan, you identify dependencies and then work along the critical path to build things in order of dependency.
Agile uses a "user-story" approach and almost guarantees both functional decomposition and maximum-rework. This is so bad that it's (almost) a truism.  That's bad.  But the actual problem is not Agile. The problem is the use of requirements (user-stories) to drive the process. More accurately it's the lack of having a plan while giving the appearance of having a plan.
The use of user-stories makes injecting any architecture and planning very difficult. Using Agile the way that it's often portrayed may well have it's roots more in prototyping.  Regardless, it's among the worst way to plan and execute a software project.  But the problem is not the Iterative, Incremental, and Empirical parts of Agile.  These aspects are required to successfully do thin slices and The Method more generally!

## Appendices

### Excerpts from [History: The Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/history.html){:target="_blank"}

- "get all the lightweight method leaders in one room"
- "organizational anarchists"
- "organizational models based on people, collaboration, and building the types of organizational communities in which we would want to work."
- "values and culture"
- avoiding "process for process’ sake"
- "The Agile movement is not anti-methodology, in fact, many of us want to restore credibility to the word methodology. We want to restore a balance. We embrace modeling, but not in order to file some diagram in a dusty corporate repository. We embrace documentation, but not hundreds of pages of never-maintained and rarely-used tomes. We plan, but recognize the limits of planning in a turbulent environment."

- "We hope that our work together as the Agile Alliance helps others in our profession to think about software development, methodologies, and organizations, in new– more agile – ways. If so, we’ve accomplished our goals." -->
