Simon & Garfunkel

<pre class="song">
[Intro]
Di di-di-di di di di-di di di di-di di
Doo doo-doo-doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo
Di-di-di-di di di di-di-di di di-di di
 
[Chorus]
And here's to you Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know, wo wo wo
God bless you please Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray, hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
 
[Verse 1]
We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
Look around you all you see are sympathetic eyes
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home
 
[Chorus]
And here's to you Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know, wo wo wo
God bless you please Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray, hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
 
[Verse 2]
Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
It's a little secret just the Robinsons' affair
Most of all you've got to hide it from the kids
 
[Chorus]
Koo-koo-ka-choo, Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know, wo wo wo
God bless you please Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray, hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
 
[Verse 3]
Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
Going to the candidates debate
Laugh about it shout about it when you've got to choose
Any way you look at it you lose
 
[Chorus]
Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you, woo woo woo
What's that you say Mrs. Robinson
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away, hey hey hey, hey hey hey

Peter, Paul & Mary (written by John Denver)

<pre class="song">
[Verse 1]
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
I'm standing here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn,
The taxi's waiting, he's blowing his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could die
 
[Chorus]
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go
 
[Verse 2]
There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around
I tell you now they don't mean a thing
Every place I go I'll think of you
Every song I sing I'll sing for you
When I come back I'll bring your wedding ring
 
[Chorus]
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go
 
[Verse 3]
Now the time has come to leave you
One more time let me kiss you
Then close your eyes I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times I won't have to say

[Chorus]
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go
 
I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
There's a place up ahead and I'm goin'
just as fast as my feet can fly.
Come away, come away if you're goin',
leave the sinkin' ship behind.
 
[Chorus]
C'mon the risin' wind,
we're goin' up around the bend. Whoooh.

Bring a song and a smile for the banjo,
better get while the gettin's good.
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
where the neons turn to wood. 
 
[Chorus]
C'mon the risin' wind,
we're goin' up around the bend.

You can ponder perpetual motion,
fix your mind for a crystal day.
Always time for a good conversation,
there's an ear for what you say.

C'mon the risin' wind,
we're goin' up around the bend.

we're goin' up around the bend.

I see the bad moon a-rising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightning
I see bad times today
 
[Chorus]
Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

I hear hurricanes a-blowing
I know the end is coming soon
I fear rivers overflowing
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

[Verse 3]
Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye

Well, don't go around tonight

There's a bad moon on the rise

[Intro]
 
[Verse 1]
 
Left a good job in the city, 
workin' for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin', 
worryin' 'bout the way things might have been
Big wheel keep on turnin', 
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
 
[Verse 2]
 
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis, 
pumped a lot of pane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city, 
'til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen
Big wheel keep on turnin', 
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
 
[Instrumental]
 
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
 
[Verse 3]
 
If you come down to the river, 
bet you're gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry, cause you have no money, 
people on the river are happy to give
 
Big wheel a-keep on turnin', 
Proud Mary keep on burnin',
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

Peter, Paul & Mary

<pre class="song">
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee
Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff
And brought him strings, and sealing wax, and other fancy stuff

Oh, Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist, in a land called Honah Lee
Puff, the magic dragon, lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist, in a land called Honah Lee

Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail
Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail
Noble kings and princes would bow whenever they came
Pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name

Oh, Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist, in a land called Honah Lee
Puff, the magic dragon, lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist, in a land called Honah Lee

A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys
Painted wings and giant's rings make way for other toys
One gray night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more
And Puff, that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar

His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane
Without his lifelong friend, Puff could not be brave
So Puff, that mighty dragon, sadly slipped into his cave

Oh, Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist, in a land called Honah Lee
Puff, the magic dragon, lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist, in a land called Honah Lee

Johnny Cash

<pre class="song">
Oh Lord my God when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made
I see the stars I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed 

Then sings my soul my Savior God to thee 
How great Thou art How great Thou art 
Then sings my soul my Savior God to thee
How great Thou art how great Thou art 

When thru the woods and forest glades I wander
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze

Then sings my soul my Savior God to thee 
How great Thou art How great Thou art 
Then sings my soul my Savior God to thee
How great Thou art how great Thou art 

And when I think that God his Son not sparing
Sent Him to die I scarce can take it in
That on the cross my burden gladly bearing
He bled and died to take away my sin

Then sings my soul my Savior God to thee 
How great Thou art How great Thou art 
Then sings my soul my Savior God to thee
How great Thou art how great Thou art 

When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And take me home what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
And there proclaim my God how great Thou art

Then sings my soul my Savior God to thee 
How great Thou art How great Thou art 
Then sings my soul my Savior God to thee
How great Thou art how great Thou art

[Verse] 

Hey Jude, don’t make it bad, 
take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart, 
then you can start to make it better
 
Hey Jude, don’t be afraid, 
you were made to go out and get her 
The minute you let her under your skin, 
then you begin to make it better
 
[Chorus]
 
And anytime you feel the pain, 
hey Jude, refrain, don’t carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool 
by making his world a little colder

Da da da da da da da da

Hey Jude, don’t let me down,

Remember to let her into your heart,

So let it out and let it in, 
hey Jude, begin, you're waiting for someone to perform with
And don’t you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do,

All your hugs and kisses and your   money too, a hell-a

Hands, touching hands
Reaching out, touching me, touching you

Sweet Caroline, good times never seemed so good
I'd be inclined to believe they never would, But now I'm

Look at the night and it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two
And when I hurt, hurting runs off my shoulder
How can I hurt when holdin' you

Reaching out, touching me, touching you

The Animals

<pre class="song">

[Verse 1]

There is a house in New Orleans
They call the "Rising Sun"
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And Lord, I know, I'm one
 
[Verse 2]

My mother was a tailor 
She sewed my new blue jeans 
My father was a gambling man
Down in New Orleans
  
[Verse 3]

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time, he's satisfied,
Is when he's on a drunk

[Verse 4]

Oh, mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of Rising Sun
  
[Verse 5]

Well, I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm going back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the "Rising Sun"
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And Lord, I know, I'm one
