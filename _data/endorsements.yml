    tagLine: I highly recommend Jeff to any budding software professional
    content: > 
      I met Jeff in the Fall of 2019 as I took my first steps into the world of software development. Jeff's ways of explaining software design and architectural concepts are unique and effective. The principles he showed me would have taken years of trial and error to learn on my own. Iâ€™m thankful to have benefited from his guidance early in my journey.  


      I have been teaching for years as a professor of chemistry, so I know a good teacher when I encounter one. Jeff shows an affinity and ability to teach and mentor that many in my profession lack. I highly recommend Jeff to any budding software professional. Time under his tutelage will pay dividends in current and future projects. His lessons on the flow of a project and the software design process revealed many missteps I had overlooked. After many wasted hours rewriting code, I can gladly avoid such frustration going forward thanks to Jeff!

      I had the great pleasure of meeting Jeff over a decade ago. I was instantly impressed with his grasp of software development and architectural/design concepts. He has a true passion that is felt immediately, and he became my "Go To" for large projects, complicated concepts, and cutting edge solutions.


      Having been in IT for 25 years and 16 of those years in software development, when I found an opportunity to have Jeff as a mentor I jumped at the chance. I wanted to benefit from his strong leadership skills, passion, and personal drive for constant learning and improvement. Jeff has
      shared great insights, concepts and has given me the push I needed to not only continue my professional development but my personal growth as well.


      I highly recommend Jeff to anyone that wants to be challenged and to grow professionally & personally, Jeff genuinely cares and wants to share and develop together and to help you achieve your goals. I will always be grateful for Jeff's time, friendship, & guidance and I believe others will feel the same. I highly recommend Jeff to anyone wanting to grow personally and professionally.

      Jeff has the exceptional ability to quickly and elegantly express ideas in clean, working code. He has experience in doing that in every aspect of a software project - server, mobile, web, "cloud," whatever. He has courage to "dive in" and embrace new challenges. Combined with a passion for sharing his knowledge, an eagerness to engage with others, and a servant heart, he is a software engineering leader.
