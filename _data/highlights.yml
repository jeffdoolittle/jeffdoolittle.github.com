    Software professionals regularly find ourselves writing for various purposes.
    Improved writing skills are critical to ensure clarity of communication and intent.
    In my latest episode on Software Engineering Radio I spoke with Philip Kiely about
    his recently published book
    <a href="/2020/09/15/writing-for-software-developers-with-philip-kiely">Writing for Software Developers</a>.
    Give it a listen and grab a copy of the book to build your skills as a professional
    who writes technical content.
