projects:
  - title: MRP System with ERP Integration for a National Premium Juice producer
    summary: Complete Supply-Chain Forecasting, Planning and Traceability
    content: >
      Worked with a team to build a customized materials resource planning system using VB, MS
      Access and MS SQL to meet the specific and specialized needs of the company. The system
      tracked and traced product through the entire lifecycle from purchasing procurement, raw
      material and packaging in-transit, receiving, inventory, production staging, production, post
      production, finished goods, order fulfillment, and outbound shipping.
      The system included a powerful forecasting module which, given a specified expected product
      demand, would generate a full bill of materials for all necessary production inputs. The
      forecasting module would determine what on-hand product was available to fulfill the forecast,
      as well as what product would need to be purchased, including the necessary lead times for
      receiving the raw materials. This allowed for just-in-time production planning, reducing the cost
      of carrying an excessive raw materials inventory.


      Additionally, a C# .Net windows mobile application was created for raw material receiving,
      inventory management, finished goods management, and order fulfillment. This application
      removed the need for paper, significantly reduced order fulfillment errors, and greatly improved
      data collection efficiency and accuracy. The near-real time nature of the application allowed
      business decisions to be made in a more nimble fashion, and eradicated the need for data entry
      from a paper source, minimizing errors and increasing efficiency.

  - title: Product Quality Tracking System for a major producer of fruit cups
    summary: Quality Data Collection Efficiency and Accuracy
    content: >
      Designed a customized product quality reporting application. The system was designed to track
      dozens of key quality metrics, measured at multiple intervals throughout the production cycle.
      Quality metrics were used to inform various business decisions related to product safety,
      specification conformity, and fitness regarding customer requirements.
      Integrated with Mettler Toledo scales for verifying product weight tolerances in an automated
      fashion.


  - title: Charter Bus Company System Migration
    summary: Scheduling Accuracy and Communication Clarity
    content: >
      Migrated a legacy VB6 application to C# .Net for charter bus logistics. This application is the
      primary tool of business operations for this client so success was mission critical. Major features
      included ordering, CRM, billing, accounts receivable, dispatch management, and driver payroll.
      Additionally, created a WPF large-font dispatch dashboard, similar to arrival/departure screens
      seen in airports. This application auto-provisioned multiple scheduled days across a dynamic
      number of connected large screen monitors. The application greatly improved schedule visibility
      and collaboration, removed the need to manually write on a blackboard, reduced errors, and
      allowed schedule modifications directly in the application without the need to erase and rewrite.

  - title: Diversified Farming Operation Systems
    summary: Diverse Solutions for a Diversified Operation
    content: >
      Created multiple applications for a $100M revenue diversified farming operation.
      Built a budgeting system for planning resource allocations across all aspects of the farming
      operation, including expected labor allocations, water allocations, plantings, equipment usage,
      and land related expenses. Most agricultural budgeting systems are built for smaller operations
      that budget per cost center (field). This system was designed to allow for budgeting by groups of
      cost centers, allowing for budgeting and allocations at a higher level. This approach increased
      efficiency of creating budgets, including various trial budgets for comparison. It also alleviated
      the previous requirement for accountants to budget at an excessively granular level, or perform
      their budgeting in a disconnected system such as Excel.
      Also built a farm labor tracking system which provided a shared interface for Labor Contractors
      and the company for payroll calculations and reporting.

  - title: Fresh Produce Inspections SaaS System
    summary: Inspection Data Straight to the Hands of Critical Decision Makers
    content: >
      Built the best-in-class, de facto cloud-hosted web and mobile application for Fresh Produce
      inspections. The system enabled produce companies to customize their inspection protocols
      according to the demands of their various critical control points such as receiving, packing, cold
      storage and shipping. The real-time nature of the quality data collection enabled users to make
      more accurate and efficient decisions regarding production scheduling, and product-customer
      fit.
    
  - title: Agricultural Harvest Scheduling SaaS System
    summary: Efficiency, Accuracy and Clarity
    content: >
      Built a cloud hosted web and mobile collaboration application for agricultural harvest scheduling.
      The application replaced Excel spreadsheets, emails and text messages previously in use for
      managing harvest scheduling and logistics. The application improved communication accuracy
      and efficiency between the different participants in the harvest process, and enabled improved
      production planning based on more accurate harvest forecast information coming from the field.
        
  - title: Agricultural Labor Management SaaS System
    summary: Compliance and Fraud Prevention
    content: >
      Built a cloud hosted web and mobile data collection and compliance application for agricultural
      labor. The application ensured full chain of custody for all labor and production related data,
      minimizing errors and greatly reducing the ability to game the system or commit payroll and
      employment fraud. The system also contained a powerful compliance engine for ensuring
      compliance with regulatory requirements, while still allowing for innovative compensation
      strategies such as pay-per-piece.
    
    
  - title: Real-time On Demand Staffing SaaS System
    summary: Building the Gig-economy Platform
    content: >
      Advised a gig-economy staffing company on architecting their cloud hosted web and mobile staffing system. 
      Mentored senior management regarding System Design, Project Design, Process Design and Team Leadership 
      together with industry leaders from IDesign.
