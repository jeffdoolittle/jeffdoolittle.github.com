## Alignment

Have you ever driven a car that pulls to the right or left? Or perhaps one where the vehicle only went straight when the steering wheel was off center? This happens when something gets out of alignment.
Over time the alignment of a vehicle moves away from an optimal state.  Lack of alignment puts stress on the steering mechanism, increases tire wear, reduces performance, and generally makes driving more difficult. This may not have immediately damaging effects, but left unaddressed the impact will be felt.

- with your time when something breaks down
- in your wallet when you have to replace your tires more frequently
- in your safety when a tire wears down from poor alignment and blows unexpectedly

A properly maintained alignment saves time and money in the long run. But since negative impacts may not materialize right away, many drivers don't pay attention until it's too late.

## Five Factors of Cultural Alignment

In a similar fashion, a lack of cultural alignment leads to negative outcomes for teams and organizations. And just like a car, it often goes unnoticed or neglected while the risks ramp up and the ramifications become more costly and challenging to remedy.

Mechanics use diagnostic tools and standard practices to realign your car. The Five-factor Cultural Alignment model provides the same benefits for organizational and team leaders.

[**Values**](#values) are the guide rails of organizational culture. They provide *perspective and guidance* from the highest level all the way down to the most granular and tactical level.

A clear and compelling [**Vision**](#vision-and-mission) provides a *future-oriented*, guiding north-star that paints a picture of the ideal an organization wants to bring into reality.

A concise and comprehensive [**Mission**](#vision-and-mission) defines the *present-oriented* focus needed to work toward the vision.

[**Strategies**](#strategies-and-tactics) answer the questions *why, who, what, when and how much* in relation to the [mission](#vision-and-mission).

[**Tactics**](#strategies-and-tactics) define the *how* in relation to well defined and documented [strategies](#strategies-and-tactics).

### Values

It's pretty typical for organizations to define a set of corporate values. It's also typical for team members to ignore these values or view tham as useless window dressing. This perspective is frequenlty left unchallenged when organizations publish a set of values but do not discuss them frequently and highlight situations when they are successfully demonstrated. Failure to recognize and reward the embodiment of stated values can leave team members feeling jaded and unmotivated.

Ditching the concept of values altogether isn't the answer. What organizations need is a simple set of understandable values that provide *perspective and guidance* for every human interaction between all stakeholders, inside and outside the organization.

Regardless of an organization's stated values, there are three critical values that must be embraced and embodied by every organization that seeks maximum cultural effectiveness: [**Trust, Clarity and Empowerment**](/software-leadership/software-leadership-distilled#core-values). [Software Leadership Distilled](/software-leadership/software-leadership-distilled) describes these values and how to combine with other powerful leadership and organizational techniques to supercharge organizations and teams.
