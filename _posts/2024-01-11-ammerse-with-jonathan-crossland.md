[Jonathan Crossland](https://github.com/JonathanCrossland){:target="blank"} software architect, author, and business owner, joined me on [Software Engineering Radio](https://se-radio.net/team/jeff-doolittle){:target="blank"} for a conversation about the [AMMERSE](https://ammerse.org){:target="blank"} framework of design principles. We discussed the agile manifesto as a statement of values, and Jonathan shared his perspective based on his experience as a software developer and business owner. We explored the three layers of the [AMMERSE](https://ammerse.org){:target="blank"} framework and how they help business and engineering leaders to align their values, thereby improving their ability to collaborate and reach common goals.
