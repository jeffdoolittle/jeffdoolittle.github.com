Tanmai Gopal, CEO of Hasura.io, joined me on Software Engineering Radio for a conversation about GraphQL.

Tanmai described how GraphQL differs from other API specification styles such as REST and gRPC. Various concepts related to GraphQL were also explored such as performance, caching, and security.
