# Jesus, Lord of the World

I trust him, not empires or worldly kingdoms.

I trust him with my future, employment, finances, family, health, friendships, housing, investments.

I trust him with my time, each day and hour, every moment.

I trust him with my talents. They came from him, they are his, to be used for his purposes, to glorify him and bless others.

I trust him with my treasures. Every account, every investment, every asset, every liability, every paycheck, every penny is his, to be used for his purposes, to glorify him and bless others.

Guitar playing, songwriting, bible study, reading, programming, driving, eating, sleeping, communicating, relaxing, hanging out, watching movies, serving my bride and my children, doing chores, whether mundane or spectacular, tedious or exciting, challenging or simple, everything **for his glory**.

**Take it all, my Lord, my Sovereign, my Savior, my only Passion and Pursuit.**
