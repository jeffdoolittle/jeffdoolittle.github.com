Ipek Ozkaya joined me on [Software Engineering Radio]({{ page.episode_url }}){:target="blank"} to discuss a [book she co-authored entitled, Managing Technical Debt](https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Technical-Debt-Development-Engineering/dp/013564593X){:target="blank"}. In the book, Ozkaya and her co-authors describe nine principles of technical debt management to aid software companies in identifying, measuring, tracking and paying down technical debt. During the episode, she provides some unique perspectives on the definition of technical debt and provides helpful insights from both her research and personal experience.
