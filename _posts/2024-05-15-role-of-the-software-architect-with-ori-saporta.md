[Ori Saporta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ori-saporta-9023b43/){:target="blank"}, co-founder and Systems Architect at vFunction, joined me on Software Engineering Radio for a conversation about the role of the software architect. The episode begins with Oriâ€™s thoughts on what is typically missed or overlooked regarding this role. The conversation then explores aspects of both hard and soft skills required of software architects. Other topics include the relationship of the software architect to other roles, to design and process, and to quality. The show concludes by addressing the importance of dependency management by software architects.
