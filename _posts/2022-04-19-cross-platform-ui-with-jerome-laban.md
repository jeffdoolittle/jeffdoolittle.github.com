Jérôme Laban, CTO of Uno Platform, joined me for a conversation about cross-platform user interfaces. We discussed the unique challenges and possibilities related to applications designed to run on multiple platforms — issues such as platform fidelity versus product-specific fidelity, including the trade-offs between a lowest-common-denominator approach and embracing each specific platform's interaction patterns and presentation styles. We also explored the risks of over-reliance on tools over design goals, as well as the unique challenges related to prioritizing technical issues in relation to business goals and customer expectations.
