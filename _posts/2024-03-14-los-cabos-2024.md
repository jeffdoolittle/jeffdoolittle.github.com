      After 3 days in Cabo Pulmo, it was time to head to La Paz. On the way, we stopped at Cañon de la Zorra, an oasis in the middle of the desert.

    summary: >
      After our brief respite in Cañon de la Zorra we continued the trek to La Paz. La Paz is an industrial city located on a beautiful bay with gorgeous protected islands in the distance. Primary activities included laying on the beach, snorkeling, and swimming with Whale Sharks. We got so close to them it was crazy! Unfortunately, there are no pictures of the whale shark swimming, but let me tell you, it was spectacular.

    summary: >
      Our 4 days in La Paz went by fast and we headed for Todos Santos. Todos Santos is a city on the Pacific (western) side of the peninsula. It was definitely the most gringo-influenced city on our trip. It felt like an expensive California central coast town like Monterrey or Carmel.
