## Update as of 9/11/2020 9:00 AM

Yesterday the remainder of Clackamas County was placed on alert [Level 1](https://www.clackamas.us/wildfires){:target="_blank"}. Our neighborhood was elevated to [Level 2](https://www.clackamas.us/wildfires){:target="_blank"}. The emergency alert system functioned well yesterday, notifying us on our phones when the alert level changed.

We have a neighbor working on the front lines of the evacuation and looting prevention efforts. Yes, sadly, you read that correctly. He and his wife have been providing us with additional information about the fire and the situation surrounding it.

We stayed home last night with our important belongings and necessities packed and ready to go. Wonderful friends from our church family have offered us shelter in the event we need it. We hope it doesn't come to that. Our hearts go out to those who have already evacuated, and especially those with nowhere to go.

Clackamas County has provided a [Wildfire Evacuation Zones Map](https://ccgis-mapservice.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=fe0525732f1a4f679b75a5ccf1c84b30){:target="_blank"} that also shows the locations of the fires themselves.

The first map below shows our neighborhood (<span style="color: #11AAFF">blue dot</span>) in relation to the [alert levels](https://www.clackamas.us/wildfires){:target="_blank"}. Level 1 is green, 2 is yellow and 3 is red. *Note: This first map **does not** reflect the location of the fires.*

The second map shows our neighborhood (<span style="color: #11AAFF">blue circle</span>) in relation to the fires themselves. Our home is about 5 miles from the nearest hotspot, and about 15 from the large Riverside Fire in the middle of the image.

The anxiety and ambiguity of the situation have taken an emotional toll on us, but we remain in relatively good spirits. Thank you for reading and for your concern for our family, our neighbors, our county, and everyone else experiencing difficulties and tragedies due to the fires all over the western US.
