Ryan Magee, a software engineer at the LIGO Laboratory, joined me on Software Engineering Radio for a conversation about software engineering in physics research. We discussed the history of the LIGO project, the challenges of building software for a scientific instrument, and the role of software engineering scientific research. Ryan also described the software engineering practices used in the LIGO project, and how they have evolved over time.
