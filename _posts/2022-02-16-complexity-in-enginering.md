## Complexity in Engineering

This week I had the distinct pleasure to appear as a guest for the The Engineering Career Coach podcast to talk about the sources of complexity and strategies for containing it.

Listen to [The Engineering Career Coach Episode 268: How Engineers Can Manage Complexity in Their Organizations](https://engineeringmanagementinstitute.org/tecc-268-engineers-manage-complexity-organizations/).

Watch the episode on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJQrMYHTMLM).
