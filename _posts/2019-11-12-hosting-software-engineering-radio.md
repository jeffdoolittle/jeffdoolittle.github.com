Back in August I discovered the [Software Engineering Radio](https://se-radio.net){:target="_blank"} ([SE Radio](https://se-radio.net){:target="_blank"}) podcast and immediately became hooked. It covered a broad range of topics, and I enjoyed that the show included a team of hosts, differentiating it from the many single-host podcasts.

During one of the episodes, the host mentioned that [SE Radio](https://se-radio.net){:target="_blank"} was looking for new hosts to join their team. I figured I was too late to the party, but put my name in the hat anyway. After completing the interview process, I was thrilled to discover that I made the cut and was invited to join the team.

I am especially pleased to announce that **my first episode as a host was published today**!

[Episode 388: Bob Kepford on Decoupled Content Management Systems](https://www.se-radio.net/2019/11/episode-388-bob-kepford-on-decoupled-content-management-systems/){:target="_blank"}

Make sure you go subscribe to the show with [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/6UO3XQclSuNnGxB39QdAnL){:target="_blank"}, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHJB2bhmgB7esz0BxMCt1jJwsoaqWtFff){:target="_blank"}, [iTunes](https://feeds.feedburner.com/se-radio?mt=2&ls=1){:target="_blank"}, [Android](https://subscribeonandroid.com/www.se-radio.net/feed/podcast/){:target="_blank"}, or [RSS](https://www.se-radio.net/feed/podcast/){:target="_blank"}.

In future episodes I plan to focus the majority of my time discussing Software Architecture, Project Design, Team Dynamics, and Leadership in the context of Software Engineering. Stay tuned!
