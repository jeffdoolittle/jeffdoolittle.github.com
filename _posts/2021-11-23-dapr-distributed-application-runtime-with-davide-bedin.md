Davide Bedin, a cloud solution architect at Microsoft and professional Dapr enthusiast joined me to discuss his book, [Practical Microservices with Dapr and .NET](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Practical-Microservices-with-Dapr-and-.NET){:target="blank"}. [Dapr (the Distributed Application Runtime)](https://dapr.io){:target="blank"} simplifies cloud-native application development by providing standards-based solutions for common application requirements. This approach provides a clean separation of core application logic from typical infrastructural concerns. Davide’s book helps application developers get started using Dapr with an introduction to its core building blocks. We discussed some of these in detail during the episode, such as service invocation, state management, and publish & subscribe. Our conversation addressed topics related to Dapr as a community-driven open source initiative that has adopted open standards, such as those published by the CNCF. We also discussed practices for adopting Dapr in both greenfield applications and existing systems, as well as the relationship of Dapr to container orchestration technologies such as Kubernetes.
