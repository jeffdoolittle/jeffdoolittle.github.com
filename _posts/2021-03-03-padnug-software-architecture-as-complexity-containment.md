Recently, I had the distinct pleasure to present once again for my hometown technology user group on a topic that is near and dear to my heart - *Software Architecture as Complexity Containment*.

## Errata

All mistakes are my own and not the responsibility of any authors or practitioners mentioned during the presentation.

- When referring to a 7 node, acyclic graph, I stated that it allows for 5,040 combinations. This actually applies to the 7 node network with no constraints on connections between them.

Please [contact me](/contact) if you find any other errata from the presentation.
