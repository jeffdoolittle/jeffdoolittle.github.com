Hello friends! It's been a few days since I've had time to sit and write about what God has taught me lately. I'm going through an employment transition that I'll write more about once it is completed. This has left me with less time to reflect, process and write.

During the transition, I've traded most of my writing time for reading time. I can't put [Insurgence](http://insurgence.org/){:target="_blank"} down. This book by [Frank Viola](http://frankviola.org/){:target="_blank"} challenges me to my core. I encourage you to investigate more about the book and about Frank. If you do pick up a copy and read it, I'd love to hear back from you about what you're learning and how you are growing.

My employment transition will not be complete until September 4th. Until that time my writing stream will most likely remain a trickle. But there's more to come in the near future and I look forward to continuing to invite you to join me on the journey of Pursuing Peace.

Blessings to you!

--Jeff
