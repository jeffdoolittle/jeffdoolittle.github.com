## TL;DR

> Wait, did you present this before?

Yes, it's true! But this recent presentation provides more provocotive ideas for you to ponder as you consider whether REST and microservices really make your life better as a software engineer.

## About the Presentation

On May 11, 2021 I had the privilege to present at the [Spokane .NET User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Spokane-NET-User-Group/){:target="_blank"} (formerly called the Portland Area Dot Net User Group). There were some technical glitches with the original video posting, hence the long delay in posting this video.

We explored various questions and topics together, including:

* What is REST?
* What are Microservices?
* Where did these ideas originate?
* Do we actually understand these terms?
* Do we even need to understand these ideas?
* Does REST actually wreck microservices?

And of course the ultimate question:

> How can software professionals avoid the Pit of Despair?

I invite you to join me and our special guest, Inigo Montoya, as we delve into these questions and many more.
