I checked an item off of my bucket list this summer!

> take each of my kids on a father-daughter/father-son mission trip. check!

Jack and I travelled to Costa Rica from late July through early August with a team of 10 from Kingsburg. Joining us were two young ladies from Texas, and a young man from New York.

I led the team and Jack worked in the Creative Arts Workshop during our time in Costa Rica. We also spent a day visiting the beautiful [La Paz Waterfall Gardens](http://www.waterfallgardens.com/){:target="_blank"}.

We had an amazing time connecting with old friends from previous trips, and making new ones. I am grateful we had this opportunity to serve and I can hardly wait to return!
