I've been putting together parts and pieces of instrumental, acoustic guitar songs for a while now. Last Summer my friend Clint and I transformed his living room into a makeshift recording studio. We spent a day putting those parts and pieces together into complete compositions. What resulted is raw and unfinished, but gives a sense of what is to come.

The working title of the project is "Hope in the Dark."

The demo recordings are available for your listening pleasure on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jeffdoolittle/sets/hope-in-the-dark" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPYkyQO5Bq3QDskM05kb-szUDIFCZIMtQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. After you've had a listen, I'd appreciate your feedback below, such as whether you'd be interested in purchasing, or helping support the recording of a full album.

In the near future, we're planning to get into a real studio and record enough high quality compositions to release a full album. Stay tuned, there's more to come.
