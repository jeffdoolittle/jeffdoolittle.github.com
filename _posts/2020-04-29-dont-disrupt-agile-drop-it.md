## About the Article

A few weeks ago, the Cutter Business Technology Journal posted a [Call for Papers](https://www.cutter.com/call-papers#disruptagile){:target="_blank"} to address the following questions:

> Can it be said that after roughly two decades of practice, "agile" is now itself ready for disrupting? If so, why? And, what would disruption look like?

I responded to the call and I am pleased to announce that my paper has been published and is [available for download](https://www.cutter.com/article/don%E2%80%99t-disrupt-agile-drop-it){:target="_blank"}.

Here are some highlights from the paper:

> Targeting agility as a goal for software teams has diminished over time, being replaced instead with efforts to “do Agile” by following prescribed, formulaic practices.

> Successful businesses recognize the need to adapt in the face of market competition, industry complexity, and the relentless turbulence of the technology landscape. They do not measure success by conformity to a set
of methodologies or practices, regardless of intriguing names or prestigious sounding certifications.
