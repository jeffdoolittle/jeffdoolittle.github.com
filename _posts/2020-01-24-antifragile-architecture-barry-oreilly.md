What if I told you it is possible to design systems that not only survive under duress, but actually improve? Such systems display characteristics beyond mere robustness, becoming "antifragile," a term coined by [Nassim Taleb](https://twitter.com/nntaleb){:target="_blank"}, author of [Fooled by Randomness](https://www.amazon.com/Incerto-Deluxe-Randomness-Procrustes-Antifragile/dp/198481981X){:target="_blank"}, [The Black Swan](https://www.amazon.com/Incerto-Deluxe-Randomness-Procrustes-Antifragile/dp/198481981X){:target="_blank"}, and, of course, [Antifragile](https://www.amazon.com/Incerto-Deluxe-Randomness-Procrustes-Antifragile/dp/198481981X){:target="_blank"}. Antifragile systems not only withstand stressors and volatility in a complex environment, but actually gain from such disorder and chaos.

I recently had the privilege to interview [Barry O'Reilly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barry-o-reilly-b924657/){:target="_blank"} of [Black Tulip Technologies](https://blacktulip.se){:target="_blank"} for [Software Engineering Radio](https://se-radio.net){:target="_blank"}. Barry and I discussed the nature of antifragile software architecture and systems. In particular, Barry outlined certain processes and approaches that can guide businesses and software architects toward designing antifragile systems.

You don't want to miss this excellent discussion of antifragility in software systems.
