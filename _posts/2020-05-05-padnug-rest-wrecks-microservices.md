## About the Presentation

On May 5, 2020 I had the privilege to present at the [PADNUG](https://www.meetup.com/PADNUG/events/jscxtmybchbhb/){:target="_blank"} (formerly called the Portland Area Dot Net User Group).

We explored various questions and topics together, including:

* What is REST?
* What are Microservices?
* Where did these ideas originate?
* Do we actually understand these terms?
* Do we even need to understand these ideas?
* Does REST actually wreck microservices?

And of course the ultimate question:

> How can software professionals avoid the Pit of Despair?

I invite you to join me and our special guest, Inigo Montoya, as we delve into these questions and many more.
