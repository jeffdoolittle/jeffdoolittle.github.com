**TL;DR - [Register Now!](#register)**

Distributed systems present unique challenges and difficulties for system designers and maintainers. No silver bullet can perfectly meet these challenges or magically resolve such difficulties. But sometimes taking a different approach to a problem can simplify the process of defining a system and make it easier to communicate the intent of the designer. In the [Fight for Clarity]({% post_url 2020-11-04-software-leadership-distilled %}#core-values), the value of improving the shared understanding of the design cannot be overstated.

In The Art of Immutable Architecture, Michael L. Perry describes an approach to distributed system design based on fundamental principles of mathematics, logic and immutability. Applying the constraints and patterns described in the book can greatly reduce the effort required of system designers and implementers when dealing with the challenges of distributed systems.

The [Immutable Architecture Book Club]({{ page.url }}) will, of course, explore the principles of immutable architecture. But even better, you'll come away with practical knowledge and tools you can use to begin applying these principles in your own system design and implementation endeavors. As an added bonus Michael will join us for a few strategic sessions throughout the duration of the club.

**You don't want to miss out on this opportunity to grow as a software professional and connect with like-minded colleagues and industry experts.**

The book club will meet at 8 AM Pacific Time for 15 weeks from August 12 to November 18, 2021. See the [Schedule](#schedule) below for details.
