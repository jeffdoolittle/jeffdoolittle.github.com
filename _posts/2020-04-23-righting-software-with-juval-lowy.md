[Hosting Software Engineering Radio](https://www.se-radio.net/team/jeff-doolittle/){:target="_blank"} has given me incredible opportunities to speak with software industry veterans, influencers and leaders. I recently had the privilege to interview software legend [Juval Löwy](http://idesign.net/About){:target="_blank"} about his recently published book, _[Righting Software](https://rightingsoftware.org){:target="_blank"}_. Juval has been teaching master classes for software architects for decades. This book summarizes Juval's Method for System and Project Design which had previously been available exclusively through his classes. Now for the first time in print, _[Righting Software](https://rightingsoftware.org){:target="_blank"}_ expands access to his ideas and techniques to the industry at large.

In our conversation on [Software Engineering Radio](https://se-radio.net){:target="_blank"}, we discussed Juval's perspective on the state of the software industry and what can be done to make it right.
