> #### I highly recommend Jeff to anyone wanting to grow personally and professionally

I had the great pleasure of meeting Jeff over a decade ago. I was instantly impressed with his
grasp of software development and architectural/design concepts. He has a true passion that is
felt immediately, and he became my "Go To" for large projects, complicated concepts, and
cutting edge solutions.

Having been in IT for 25 years and 16 of those years in software development, when I found an
opportunity to have Jeff as a mentor I jumped at the chance. I wanted to benefit from his strong
leadership skills, passion, and personal drive for constant learning and improvement. Jeff has
shared great insights, concepts and has given me the push I needed to not only continue my
professional development but my personal growth as well.

I highly recommend Jeff to anyone that wants to be challenged and to grow professionally &
personally, Jeff genuinely cares and wants to share and develop together and to help you
achieve your goals. I will always be grateful for Jeff's time, friendship, & guidance and I believe
others will feel the same. I highly recommend Jeff to anyone wanting to grow personally and
professionally.
