### Jeremiah Baird, CPO, GigRonin

> #### I highly recommend Jeff to anyone wanting to grow personally and professionally

I had the great pleasure of meeting Jeff over a decade ago. I was instantly impressed with his
grasp of software development and architectural/design concepts. He has a true passion that is
felt immediately, and he became my "Go To" for large projects, complicated concepts, and
cutting edge solutions.

Having been in IT for 25 years and 16 of those years in software development, when I found an
opportunity to have Jeff as a mentor I jumped at the chance. I wanted to benefit from his strong
leadership skills, passion, and personal drive for constant learning and improvement. Jeff has
shared great insights, concepts and has given me the push I needed to not only continue my
professional development but my personal growth as well.

I highly recommend Jeff to anyone that wants to be challenged and to grow professionally &

## MRP System with ERP Integration for a National Premium Juice producer 1999-2007

Worked with a team to build a customized materials resource planning system using VB, MS
Access and MS SQL to meet the specific and specialized needs of the company. The system
tracked and traced product through the entire lifecycle from purchasing procurement, raw
material and packaging in-transit, receiving, inventory, production staging, production, post
production, finished goods, order fulfillment, and outbound shipping.
The system included a powerful forecasting module which, given a specified expected product
demand, would generate a full bill of materials for all necessary production inputs. The
forecasting module would determine what on-hand product was available to fulfill the forecast,
as well as what product would need to be purchased, including the necessary lead times for
receiving the raw materials. This allowed for just-in-time production planning, reducing the cost
of carrying an excessive raw materials inventory.

Additionally, a C# .Net windows mobile application was created for raw material receiving,
inventory management, finished goods management, and order fulfillment. This application
removed the need for paper, significantly reduced order fulfillment errors, and greatly improved
data collection efficiency and accuracy. The near-real time nature of the application allowed
business decisions to be made in a more nimble fashion, and eradicated the need for data entry
from a paper source, minimizing errors and increasing efficiency.

## Product Quality Tracking System for a major producer of fruit cups

Designed a customized product quality reporting application. The system was designed to track
dozens of key quality metrics, measured at multiple intervals throughout the production cycle.
Quality metrics were used to inform various business decisions related to product safety,
specification conformity, and fitness regarding customer requirements.
Integrated with Mettler Toledo scales for verifying product weight tolerances in an automated
fashion.

## Charter Bus Company System Migration

Migrated a legacy VB6 application to C# .Net for charter bus logistics. This application is the
primary tool of business operations for this client so success was mission critical. Major features
included ordering, CRM, billing, accounts receivable, dispatch management, and driver payroll.
Additionally, created a WPF large-font dispatch dashboard, similar to arrival/departure screens
seen in airports. This application auto-provisioned multiple scheduled days across a dynamic
number of connected large screen monitors. The application greatly improved schedule visibility
and collaboration, removed the need to manually write on a blackboard, reduced errors, and
allowed schedule modifications directly in the application without the need to erase and rewrite.

## Diversified Farming Operation Systems

Created multiple applications for a $100M revenue diversified farming operation.
Built a budgeting system for planning resource allocations across all aspects of the farming
operation, including expected labor allocations, water allocations, plantings, equipment usage,
and land related expenses. Most agricultural budgeting systems are built for smaller operations
that budget per cost center (field). This system was designed to allow for budgeting by groups of
cost centers, allowing for budgeting and allocations at a higher level. This approach increased
efficiency of creating budgets, including various trial budgets for comparison. It also alleviated
the previous requirement for accountants to budget at an excessively granular level, or perform
their budgeting in a disconnected system such as Excel.
Also built a farm labor tracking system which provided a shared interface for Labor Contractors
and the company for payroll calculations and reporting.

## Fresh Produce Inspections SaaS System

Built the best-in-class, de facto cloud-hosted web and mobile application for Fresh Produce
inspections. The system enabled produce companies to customize their inspection protocols
according to the demands of their various critical control points such as receiving, packing, cold
storage and shipping. The real-time nature of the quality data collection enabled users to make
more accurate and efficient decisions regarding production scheduling, and product-customer
fit.

## Agricultural Harvest Scheduling SaaS System

Built a cloud hosted web and mobile collaboration application for agricultural harvest scheduling.
The application replaced Excel spreadsheets, emails and text messages previously in use for
managing harvest scheduling and logistics. The application improved communication accuracy
and efficiency between the different participants in the harvest process, and enabled improved
production planning based on more accurate harvest forecast information coming from the field.

## Agricultural Labor Management SaaS System

Built a cloud hosted web and mobile data collection and compliance application for agricultural
labor. The application ensured full chain of custody for all labor and production related data,
minimizing errors and greatly reducing the ability to game the system or commit payroll and
employment fraud. The system also contained a powerful compliance engine for ensuring
compliance with regulatory requirements, while still allowing for innovative compensation
strategies such as pay-per-piece.

## Real-time On Demand Staffing SaaS System

Advised GigRonin on architecting their cloud hosted web and mobile staffing system. Mentored
senior management regarding System Design, Project Design, Process Design and Team
Leadership.
